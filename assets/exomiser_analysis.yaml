# Possible pathogenicitySources: (POLYPHEN, MUTATION_TASTER, SIFT), (REVEL, MVP), CADD, REMM, SPLICE_AI, ALPHA_MISSENSE
# REMM is trained on non-coding regulatory regions
# *WARNING* if you enable CADD or REMM ensure that you have downloaded and installed the CADD/REMM tabix files
# and updated their location in the application.properties. Exomiser will not run without this.
